<p>
In recent years, the area of computing has undergone a radical transformation, wherein systems that were hardware-centric, such as medical devices, vehicles, and power grids, are now predominantly defined and managed by AI-empowered software. As we enter this new era, the importance of ensuring software reliability and efficiency has never been greater. With traditional techniques such as classical model-based software engineering and analysis become insufficient in handling the increasing scales and complexities of today's systems, we are faced with an urgent need for new approaches that can effectively tackle these challenges. Towards this, my research takes an integrated approach that combines software automation, model-based engineering, and AI-driven techniques to improve software reliability and efficiency in a wide range of application domains, from resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) to colossal data centers and industrial control systems.
